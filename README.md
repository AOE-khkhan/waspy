Wing Aerostructural Studies in Python

![WASPY](waspy.jpg)

This repo contains all the files needed to produce the results presented in Jasa et al's 2019 Aviation paper on aerostructural wing design.
We use [OpenAeroStruct](https://github.com/mdolab/OpenAeroStruct) for all studies.

## Gameplan

First focus on uCRM. Get all results for it first. Then branch out to Q400 and tiltwing if time allows.

0. baseline wing
1. viscous
2. wave drag added
3. compressibility?
4. structural weight relief
5. fuel weight relief
6. engine mass added
7. engine thrust added
